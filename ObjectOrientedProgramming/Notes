- object is an instance of a class

- objects are just like real life, object.
    - we can assign attributes = is/has
    - ex. name, age, height

- in order to create an object we need a class -

A class can function as a blueprint to create objects
    - Assign attributes
        Assign what an object is
    - Methods
        What each object can do
    - innit method
        pass in arguments and assign the arguments to each objects attributes
    - goal is to use class as a blueprint to create more objects.

Steps:
#1 Make a class
#2 initialize the constructor
#3 assign attributes to the objects
#4 make some methods
#5 make objects with attributes in main method
